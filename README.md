# COVID-19-Preventions-Control-System

This is the GitHub repository of our work on the COVID-19 preventions control system to avoid transmission of the disease. Recently, The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world since the beginning of 2020 and it still continues to affect our daily life. In this work, we investigated the most crucial COVID-19 preventions are wearing a proper face mask, avoid to touching the face with unsterilized hands, and keeping the social distance from others. For this purpose, we proposed a comprehensive prevention control system using deep CNN models. In proposed system, we trained face mask detection and face-hand interaction detection models with well-known deep CNN models. Further, we proposed a rule-based social distance controlling algorithm. To conducted our models, we collected and annotated two novel datasets. The first dataset which is named Unconstrained Face Mask Dataset (UFMD), contains around ~20k images. The second dataset which is named Unconstrained Face Hand Interaction Dataset (UFHD), contains around ~30k images.
