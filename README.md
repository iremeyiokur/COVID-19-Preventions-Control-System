# COVID-19-Preventions-Control-System

This is the GitHub repository of our work on the COVID-19 preventions control system to avoid transmission of the disease. Recently, The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world since the beginning of 2020 and it still continues to affect our daily life. In this work, we investigated the most crucial COVID-19 preventions that are wearing a proper face mask, avoid touching the face with unsterilized hands, and keeping the social distance from others. For this purpose, we proposed a comprehensive prevention control system using deep CNN models. In proposed system, we trained face mask detection and face-hand interaction detection models using well-known deep CNN models. Further, we proposed a rule-based social distance controlling algorithm. To conduct the experiments, we collected and annotated two novel datasets. The first dataset which is named as Unconstrained Face Mask Dataset (ISL-UFMD), contains 21316 face images. The second dataset which is named as Unconstrained Face Hand Dataset (ISL-UFHD), contains 32293 face images.   

Note: This repository will be updated soon and the datasets will be published.
